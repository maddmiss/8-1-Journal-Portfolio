The project for the Corner Grocer involves creating a program that processes and analyzes an input file containing a list of purchased grocery items and their frequencies. The program addresses the following critical functional requirements:

•	Item Frequency Lookup: Users can input a specific item to determine how many times it was purchased.

•	Frequency Listing: The program generates a complete list of all items and their respective purchase frequencies and displays them.

•	Histogram Representation: A visual representation (histogram) of the purchase frequencies is created using asterisks or other characters, allowing for quick assessment of item popularity.

•	Program Exit: An option to exit the program gracefully.

The primary problem the program solves is the need for the Corner Grocer to efficiently analyze sales data, helping them understand customer purchasing patterns and inventory needs.

Reflecting on the project, I executed the file reading and data processing components well. Using “std::unordered_map” enhanced frequency counting efficiency, and I designed a straightforward and user-friendly user interface. Additionally, I created a modular design for the functions, which improved the readability and maintainability of the code.

While the current code is functional, I see several areas where I could enhance the project. One key area is error handling. Adding more robust error-checking for user inputs and file operations would improve reliability. For instance, I could validate user inputs before accessing the frequency map to avoid potential runtime errors. 

Moreover, exploring more advanced data structures or algorithms could optimize the solution for larger datasets. Parallel processing for counting frequencies in large files would be beneficial.

Several challenges are often encountered when aligning the information in the tables. One major issue is data consistency; varying formats or units across different datasets can lead to discrepancies and confusion. Additionally, ensuring that all entries are up-to-date and accurate can be a significant hurdle, as outdated information might skew analysis and results. 

Another challenge is synchronizing periods or categories, especially when dealing with data from multiple sources that may report different timelines or classifications. 

Working on this project has helped strengthen several transferable skills. I gained a deeper understanding of “std::unordered_map” and how to use it effectively for data management. Additionally, handling file input and output has practical applications in various programming contexts. Lastly, I honed my skills in modular programming, which is critical for maintaining clean and organized code in future projects.

To ensure the program is maintainable and adaptable, I adhered to best practices:  

•	Clear Function Names: I ensured each function name clearly describes its purpose, making it easier for anyone (including my future self) to navigate the code.  

•	Comments and Documentation: I added comments throughout to explain complex sections and provide a clear workflow overview, which will aid in future modifications. 

•	Separation of Concerns: By dividing the logic into distinct functions (like reading input, displaying output, and saving data), I made it easier to modify or enhance specific features without impacting the entire program.
